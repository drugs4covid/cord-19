        "text_t":"In this paper, we have established a PMO-functionalized G-FET nanosensor for the rapid direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in clinical throat swab samples with an attempt to realize a PCR-free identification of COVID-19. During the pandemic, this method is expected to be an effective diagnostic tool of COVID-19 with following attractive merits: (i) Detection limit is as low as 0.37 fM, which is below the other reported biosensing platform (Table S4 ). (ii) Allowing a well-defined distinction between SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and SARS-CoV RdRp. (iii) Excellent antiinterference capability and precision in undiluted biological samples (throat swab/serum) detection. (iv) Outstanding reliability and accuracy for testing of RNA extracts from real clinical specimens and a high agreement with the results of RT-PCR. (v) Rapid specific response to COVID-19 patient samples can be achieved within 2 min by real-time measurement. (â…µ) A crucial advance in this work is PCR-free direct detection without pre-amplification, which consumedly reduces the molecular diagnostic turn-around time. In summary, the yielded platform provides a rapid (~2 min), sensitive, and reliable detection strategy for SARS-CoV-2. It is hoped that this sensing platform can be used as a rapid screening tool in the emergency department. When close contacts are under medical observation, the method can be used to quickly identify infected individuals and give immediate feedback to doctors. It is believed that this is a powerful means of combating current COVID-19 as well as any future outbreaks. ",
